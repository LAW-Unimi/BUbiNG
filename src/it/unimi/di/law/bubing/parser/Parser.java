/** A generic parser for {@link HttpResponse responses}. Every parser provides the following functionalities:
 *  <ul>
 *  	<li>it acts as a {@link Filter} that is able to decide whether it can parse a certain {@link URIResponse} or not (e.g.,
 *  	based on the declared <code>content-type</code> header etc.);
 *  	<li>while {@linkplain #parse(URI, HttpResponse, LinkReceiver) parsing}, it will send the links found in the document to the
 *  	specified {@link LinkReceiver}, that will typically accumulate them or send them to the appropriate class for processing;
 *  	<li>the {@link #parse(URI, HttpResponse, LinkReceiver) parsing} method will return a digest computed on a
 *  	(possibly) suitably modified version of the document (the way in which the document it is actually modified and
 *		the way in which the hash is computed is implementation-dependent and should be commented by the implementing classes);
 *  	<li>after parsing, a {@linkplain #guessedCharset() guess of the charset used for the document} will be made available.
 *  </ul>
