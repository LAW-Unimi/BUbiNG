//RELEASE-STATUS: DIST

/** <p>The workbench is a {@link DelayQueue} queue of {@link WorkbenchEntry} instances, each associated with an IP address.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link WorkbenchEntry} contains a priority queue of {@link VisitState} instances ordered
 * by {@link VisitState#nextFetch}&mdash;the closest moment in
 * {@linkplain System#currentTimeMillis() time} at which the scheme+authority stored in the
 * {@link VisitState} is fetchable (by politeness policies). Each workbench entry has also a
 * {@link WorkbenchEntry#nextFetch} field with a similar meaning, but associated with the IP address
 * instead that with the scheme+authority, the idea being that the politeness policy for an IP can
 * be more tolerant (i.e., shorter delay) than that for an authority.
 *
 * <p>Observe that there exist, in general, {@linkplain WorkbenchEntry workbench entries} that are not
 * on the workbench, typically because all visit states the are associated with are empty.
 *
 * <p>The workbench is sorted by the <em>maximum between {@link WorkbenchEntry#nextFetch} and the
 * {@link VisitState#nextFetch} of the top of the queue of visit states</em>. This guarantees that
 * the top of the visit-state queue of the workbench entry at the top of the workbench contains a
 * URL that can be fetched by (both authority and IP) politeness if an only if a fetchable URL exists. By setting the value
 * returned by {@link Delayed#getDelay(TimeUnit)} to the truncated difference between the maximum
 * above and {@link System#currentTimeMillis()} we can just wait on a {@link DelayQueue#take()} until
 * the next {@link WorkbenchEntry} is ready (this is what {@link #acquire()} does).
 *
 * <p>A basic invariant is that <em>all workbench entries on the workbench contains nonempty queues
 * of visit states, and every visit state in a workbench entry has nonempty a URL queue</em>. Workbench
 * entries can be out of the workbench either because their top visit state has been
 * acquired by a thread, or because their visit state queue is empty. Visit states can be out
 * of the workbench also if they caused connection problems.
 *
 * <h2>Using a visit state</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@link VisitState} must be
 * {@linkplain #acquire() acquired} and then {@linkplain #release(VisitState) released}.
 * When a {@link VisitState} is acquired, its {@link WorkbenchEntry} is removed from the workbench,
 * so it is not possible to acquire any other {@link VisitState} with the same IP address. This
 * mechanism guarantees that we never download data using two different {@link FetchingThread} instances
 * from the same IP (and, <i>a fortiori</i>, from the same host or scheme+authority).
 *
 * <p>Once a visit state has been acquired, a visit can be performed by calling
 * {@link VisitState#dequeue()} to obtain (ready) URLs and {@link Frontier#enqueue(it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.bytes.ByteArrayList)} to filter
 * newly discovered URLs. More information can be found in the documentation of {@link VisitState}.
