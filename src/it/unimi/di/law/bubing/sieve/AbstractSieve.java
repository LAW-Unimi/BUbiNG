//RELEASE-STATUS: DIST

/**
 * A sort of a map, that handles (key,value) pairs of generic type. You can think of it as a long-term sieve where you can put the same k as
 * many times as you want, but that provides the following guarantees: <ul> <li>every key that is
 * {@linkplain AbstractSieve#enqueue(Object, Object) enqueued} will eventually be
 * dequeued; <li>only enqueued keys will be dequeued; <li>every key
 * will be dequeued just once. </ul>
 * Broadly, you can think of all the sieve logic as if it was like a <code>uniq</code> filter (in the sense of UN*X).
 * Here we are completely disregarding the asynchronous logic of dequeuing, which of course impacts the behaviour.
 *
 * <p>This data structure generalizes and adapts that described in the paper
 * <a href="http://www.cs.tamu.edu/academics/tr/tamu-cs-tr-2008-2-2"><em>IRLbot: Scaling to 6 Billion Pages and Beyond</em></a>
 * by Lee et al., where it was called <em>DRUM</em> (Disk Repository with Update Management). We prefer not to refer anymore to <em>disk</em>
 * in our abstract version because different implementations may decide not to use the disk in a strict sense to hold the items.
 *
 *  <p>The structure was originally described as follows:
 *  <ul>
 *  	<li>it is basically a way to store (k,v) pairs on an external data structure (we prefer to call them k and v instead of keys and values because we shall use
 *  the word key with a different meaning); k's present in the store are unique (that is, no two pairs in the store can have the same k);
 *  	<li>the data structure offers three kinds of operations, called <em>check</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>check+update</em>; typically, such operations are batched (that is,
 *  they are performed on a large input), but for the moment we prefer to describe them as if they were performed on a single input:
 *  		<ul>
 *  			<li><em>check(k,v,x)</em> takes a triple (k,v,x) (x is called the auxiliary data), and determines if k is new (i.e., no pair with k is present in the store already)
 *  or not; if it is new, the check operation just returns the triple itself (k,v,x); otherwise, it returns (k,v,x,w) where w is the value that is associated with k in the store;
 *  			<li><em>update(k,v,x)</em> if k is new, adds the pair (k,v) to the store; otherwise, i.e. if some pair (k,w) is present in the store, it changes it to (k,up(k,v,x,w)) where
 *  up is some suitable update function;
 *  			<li><em>check+update(k,v,x)</em> performs a check followed by an update, and returns what the check part would return;
 *  		</ul>
 *  	<li>actually, as we said, all operations are performed in batch and asynchronously; so, for example, <em>check</em> typically takes as input a batch of triples, and divides it into two flows:
 *  one is a copy of the triples containing new k's, the other is made of quadruples for duplicated k's (note that if some k appears more than once in the input batch, only the
 *  first time it may be considered as new). These two flows are asynchronously accessible through some other method (see below).
 *  </ul>
 *
 *
 *  <p>This implementation of the data structure is different from the one described above in the following regards:
 *  <ul>
 *  	<li>we assume (as implicitly done in the original paper) that k is a suitable hash of x, so all functions only take as input (x,v) (where x is called key and v is called a
 *  value) and k is produced as some hash applied to x (the hashing strategy is provided at construction time);
 *  	<li>only the check+update operation is available, with the following additional limitation: the flow of quadruples (i.e., the flow containing duplicate k's) is simply
 *  discarded; the update strategy (the function up described above) is by default defined by up(k,v,x,w)=v (i.e., substitute the old value with the new one), but may be changed
 *  (specifying a different update strategy at construction time): observe that, actually, up doesn't take (k,v,x,w) as input but rather (x,v,w), because of the above described change
 *  in the treatment of keys/auxiliary data;
 *      <li>the call to <em>check+update</em> is actually decoupled into two phases: the method {@link #enqueue(Object, Object)} corresponds to the call: it should be very fast,
 *  although some implementation may require it to be blocking, and will perform the check (and update) sometime in the future; when a {@link AbstractSieve#flush()} is performed,
 *  a new flow of pairs (the pairs that the  check method would return) is created: those pairs are actually provided to a {@link AbstractSieve.NewFlowReceiver} object
 *  that can decide what to do with them (see the {@link AbstractSieve.NewFlowReceiver} documentation).
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 *
 *  <p>Implementors should guarantee that all method calls are thread-safe, and as efficient
 *  as possible. The {@link #enqueue(Object, Object)} method should usually be non-blocking,
 *  but some bounded implementations may decide to make it wait until at least one element is
 *  dequeued: this event should be carefully documented. A call to {@link #flush()} guarantees that all new elements
 *  that have not yet been dequeued are made available, if any.
